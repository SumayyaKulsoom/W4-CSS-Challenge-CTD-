Challenge W4: Formatting with CSS
=====================

Goal: To create a CSS file and modify a basic HTML page into a formatted one. To gain a basic understanding of CSS.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are a method to format and affect the layout of a web page. They are text-based descriptions of the layout that can either be typed into <style> .. </style> tags in the <head> section of an HTML file, or attached as a separate file (____.css)

Fork this repository. (This will download and place the source files (w4.html and eagle.png) into a folder.)

In Dreamweaver, open up your FirstSite and open the file (w4.html) you just downloaded. Preview it in the browser and you will realise it lacks good formatting.

Edit the CSS file:
Create new rules to help modify the layout of the page to look similar to this sample page. Ensure that:
Header 1 is a different colour from header 2
The ESLR titles (eslrTitle class) are bolder and stand out from the rest of the text
The first image is to the right
The links react visually when a user hovers over them 

Submit a link to your repository and upload your CSS file on Eaglenet (http://aishk.mrooms.org/mod/assign/view.php?id=38280).
Advanced:
You may also submit another CSS file that improves the layout even further.
